1. This project is basically supposed to be a gag little thing turned possibly-actually-useful
2. My girl asked me if I can make her PC scroll through Pinterest automatically since she's so sick of manually scrolling when moodboarding
3. I made here a simple script to inject thru chrome dev tools, which can be activated via calling the function, with speed as a possible parameter for taste
4. She then asked me if I can then make it a bit more human so she can pretend to be working lol (she's has her screen live on Discord and people check in every now and then, so sometimes when the task is entirely just a placeholder until an actual one, this can be run)
5. So there ya go. I have this thing reworked and reworked until the version that it is right now, which has the option to run as the original, just a gradual predictable scroll, or an erratic version that kinda sorta seems 70% human in behavior
6. Things to improve are:
  6.1. Running and execution are a hassle, needing chrome dev tools. Must turn into an chrome extension instead
  6.2. It ain't enough to just be scrolling, and I think doing clicks are an eventual evolution to make it more convincing
  6.3. On top of 6.2., we can also introduce alt+tabbing, or even automatically creating and closing tabs to navigate and fake scroll thru
  6.4. The ultimate eng-game is, enabling the tool to actually fetch images, albeit at random, and actually copy-pasting it to an open Figma file
